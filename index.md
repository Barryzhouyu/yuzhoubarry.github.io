## About me

My name is **Yu Zhou**, and I am a Ph.D. student in **Electrical Engineering** at the **University of Notre Dame**, advised by [Prof. Mengxue Hou](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/mengxue-hou/) in the ND ROAR lab. My research lies at the intersection of **Robotics**, **Computer Vision**, and **Machine/Robot Learning**.

Prior to Notre Dame, I earned my **M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science** from **Duke University**, and my **B.S. in Mechanical Engineering** from **Florida Institute of Technology**.
