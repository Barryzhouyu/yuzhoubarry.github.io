## About me
<img src="IMG_9336.jpg" width="200" alt="Yu Zhou">
My name is **Yu Zhou**, and I am a Ph.D. student in **Electrical Engineering** at the **University of Notre Dame**, advised by [Prof. Mengxue Hou](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/mengxue-hou/) in the ND ROAR lab. My research lies at the intersection of **robotics**, **computer vision**, and **uncertainty-aware perception**.

Prior to Notre Dame, I earned my **M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science** from **Duke University**, and my **B.S. in Mechanical Engineering** from **Florida Institute of Technology**.

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on developing **3D Gaussian Splatting-based robotic perception pipelines**, emphasizing **pose estimation**, **epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty quantification**, and **active information-gain-driven path planning**. I also have experience in **object detection**, **multi-view vision**, and sensor integration for autonomous robotic systems.

Iâ€™m passionate about building systems that make robot perception more robust, interpretable, and adaptive, especially in real-world uncertain environments like underwater domains.
